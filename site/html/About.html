            <p id="about_paragraph"> All engineers participate in many small and large-scale projects during their educational life and careers. These can be individual or group projects that are assigned by either instructor or team manager. In the career stage, the projects are divided into small parts that will be assigned to a specific group. Hence, the group members will have to not only collaborate but also with other groups to deliver a good project. To do this, all members have to have good engineering and communication skills. These skills are developed in colleges where students are assigned to course projects. The instructor assigns the project to the group or an individual in the course. Also, for the group projects, members are evaluating other teammates for their performance if the instructor asks them to do so. As a result, these projects help students to develop themself and prepare them for their working life. <br>
            The first thing that needs to be done is to establish groups if they are not individual projects. This process can be done by an instructor or students can be allowed to choose their teammates. During the semester, the team will have many deliverables that are needed to be presented to the instructor such as reports or presentations. These tasks are done as a team and each team member will contribute to some extent in this process. At the end of the semester, each member can be asked to evaluate other members about their performance which will be one of the criteria for the instructor for grading. Furthermore, each student of the course is asked to evaluate all other group projects(artifacts) as well. This application aims to ease this process for instructors and students. This application will mainly perform similar tasks that are described above. It will help instructors to create groups for the project, it will assign a peer review form for each member and present it to the instructor as well as other artifacts, and it will give opportunity to students to review other projects of the course as well.</p>
